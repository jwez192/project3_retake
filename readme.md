# Project Portfolio 3.5
Welcome to my web project for my fourth portfolio class.                                                           |
This month I am building a completed front end website.                                                            |
With this project my goal is to build a guild website with inspiration from the WoW Armory.                        |
                                                                                                                   |
# What is the World of Warcraft Armory?                                                                            |
The WoW Armory is a resource webpage provided by Blizzard Entertainment for their players to preview practically   |
all information on a character. It provides details on the equipment currently worn, character combat stats,       |
character's achievements, a characters progress in the game, and what guild they are a part of if they are in one. |
There is a lot more information available but these are some of the things I want to focus on.                     |
